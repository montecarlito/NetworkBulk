**VLAN tagging = using a switch to create logical VLANs by tagging packet headers with 
	source VLAN numbers (802.1Q) between Source MAC & Ethertype (4 bytes if at all)

ARPs stay in the broadcst domain (subnet)

The life of a packet:
	1. Host sends packet
	2. Router checks arp table
	3. If not listed, rtr sends arp request
	4. Packet is forwarded
	
Longest Match is router's breaking down of addresses (static routes) into binary bits 
	and choosing best match

Static Routing vs Dynamic

TTL keeps the overhead down. Pings can tell you what someone is using.
Traceroute

UDP (VoIP, videos)
TCP (data integrity)

Ports:
	-Server uses well-known
	-Client uses RHP (random high ports)

ETHERNET HEADERS
	1. Preamble

Ethertypes:
	1. 0x0800 (IPv4)
	2. 0x0806 (ARP)
	3. 0x86DD (IPv6)

IPv4 HEADERS
	-includes IP addresses instead of MACs
	-TTL
	-Protocol of L4 
	-IP Header Start gives length (default 4x5=20) so if it's bigger that's an 
	  indicator

UDP HEADERS
	-Source Port
	-Dest Port
	-IP Protocol # 0x11 (decimal 17)

TCP HEADERS
	-Source Port
	-Dest Port
	-Sequence #
	-ACK #
	-Offset
	-TCP Flags (8,4,2,1 + 8,4,2,1; SYN+ACK = 0x12, PSH+RST = 0x0C)
		(CWR/ECE/URG/ACK + PSH/RST/SYN/FIN)

FRAGMENTATION PROCESS
	-size determined by MTU which is adjusted for efficiency/QoS/encryption/signature reduction
	  (see Frag Attack)

TTL
	-Unix typically 64 
	-Windows typically 128
	-Routers typically 255
	-defaults can be changed though

ICMP HEADERS
	-Type (Echo Request > Echo Reply > Destination Unreachable)
	-Code (Host unreachable, Fragmentation needed, Port unreachable)

APIPA
	-automated local IP addy assignment (169.244.xxx - 169.255.xxx) isn't routable

SLAAC

RFC 4862 & 793

Discreet Scans that defeat stateful firewalls:
	1. Null Flags (empty)
	2. FIN Flags (only FIN on)
	3. Christmas Tree (all Flag bits on except SYN & ACK)

Stateless firewall scans:
	1. UDP (connectionless and takes a long time)

SOCKETS:
	1. RAW
	2. Regular

NAMESPACES
	-regions where processes can share groups of resources (ie sandboxing processes on a host)
