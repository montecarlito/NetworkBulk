1. How many bits/bytes are in the src/dst fields of a TCP/UDP header and why are they important?
	-2 bytes (16 bits) each
	-The port fields represent logical addressing schemes for data transfer at Layer 4

2. The src address field shows the IPv6 addy of the packet's origination. What is the size of the
   src address field?
	-16 bytes (128 bits)

3. ICMP relays what types of info through a network?
	-It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational 		information indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or 		that a host or router could not be reached.

4. An ICMP type 8 message is used for what?
	-Echo: The data received in the echo request message must be returned in the echo reply 		message.

5. Every header must declare its payload (next protocol). In the Eth header, what field declares
   the protocol encapsulated within the frame?
	-Protocol field, byte offset 9

6. What are the DF & MF flags in the IPv4 header used for? Are these used in IPv6 headers? Why or
   why not?
	-Do not Fragment; More Fragments to follow
	-Yes, code 44. It's critical in support of communication using fragmented packets (in 		IPv6, the traffic source must do fragmentation-routers do not perform 		fragmentation of the packets they forward)

7. In the IPv4 header, what is the TTL field used for?
	-the number of hops that a packet is permitted to travel before being discarded by a 		router

8. What could an ICMP type 11 msg indicate?
	a) Code 0 = TTL exceeded in transit
	b) Code 1 = Fragment REassembly Time Exceeded

9. What are the checksum fields used for?
	-payload integrity

10. What is the diff btwn IHL and the total length fields in an IPv4 header?
	-IHL is the number of 32-bit words in the TCP header (min 5) multiplied by 4 (IPv4) to 
		get byte count
	-Total Length of IP datagram (or IP fragment); measured in bytes
