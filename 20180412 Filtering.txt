FILTERING

Routed Firewalls are cheaper but slower; can NAT and set ACLs
Transparent FWs are faster and more obscure, harder to hack (DoD/DISA preferred >> no FW making
	routing decisions)

Explicit Deny/Allow is admin specified
Implicit rule is a default behavior without additional config

Whitelisting = explicitly allowed apps/ports/protocols; ex- for ICS, servers, etc
Blacklisting = explicitly denied; popular for end user protection

Host-based FWs (ex: iptables, windows fw)
Network-based FWs are dedicated devices
	-Layer 2 (port filtering: prevents unauthorized hardware/connections)
	-Layer 3 (packet filtering, router ACLs)
	-Layer 4 (stateful inspection, protocol/flag filtering)
	-Layer 7 (app level gateways [ex: WAF, proxy, deep pkt insp])
	-pfsense is a network-based firewall with routing features

Fire Walking (enumerating FW settings)
	- Use ICMP, UDP, or TCP packets to test whether ports/protocols are allowed through 		filtering devices
	- Incrementing TTL; TTL expirations trigger ICMP TTL exceeded replies
	- Defense: block outgoing ICMP Time exceeded packets at the perimeter or use Network 		Address Translation to hide any/all internal network addresses
	-a routed FW might give feedback as a hop; transparent FWs don't

Traceroute
	-ICMP tool for Fire Walking
	-UDP tool for Linux Fire Walking
		1. -T #sets TCP syn
		2. -m #sets max TTL
		3. -p #sets destination ports (udp starts port then increment, tcp=constant)
		4. -U #sets constant udp port

IDS vs IPS
	-IDS doesn't need to be inline
	-IDS logs &/or alerts
	-IPS can drop, block, reset, sandbox...

Signatures
	1. Atomic - 
	2. Stateful - 

ACLs
	-typically on Layer3 routing/switching devices
	-similar to pkt filtering FWs
	-"permit any any" vs "deny any any"
	-Standard ACLs are placed closest to dst (99 & below)
	-Extended ACLs are placed closest to src (100 & above)

IPtables (not just for filtering)
	-Collects stats on byte/pkt counts for each rule (IP accounting)
	-Can be used for NAT, masquerading & port forwarding
	-Can perform pkt mangling to modify fields in headers
	-5 default "Chains" (see slides) that provide modular routing/output/input
	-3 standard tables: Mangle, NAT & Filter (default)
	-src rules = prerouting
	-dst rules = postrouting
