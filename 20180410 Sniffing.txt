WATCHING THE WIRE (NETWORK SNIFFING)
	1. Sofware (WS) vs Hardware (Tap) sniffing
		-WS is detailed but isn't as good with large pcaps
		-WS Remote Capture Interface uses WinPcap
		-WS can export objects
		-WS can decrypt traffic if you have access to the keys
		-WS Geolocation (maxmind.com DBs)
		-TCPDump is less taxing for large amounts of traffic (-X gives payload info)
		-both use same filters (excluding Berkeley Packet Filters)
	2. Mirrored (Span) port vs TAP (Test Access Point)
		-SPAN (Switch Port Analyzer) is a low-cost switch feature with low load capacity
		-TAP doesn't drop packets but costs more
	3. NIC modes
		-Promiscuous mode #NIC takes everything it sees
		-sniffing is generally passive

~$tcpdump -vv -w example.pcap -i eth0 #extra verbose written to file from eth0
~$tcpdump 'src 192.168.0.1 tcp port 80' -r example.pcap #captures all tcp traffic at addy

Why is DNS sniffing important???
	-can contribute to MitM atk, DNS poisoning, data exfil, botnet C2, detect callbacks

BERKELEY PACKET FILTERS
	-allows a user-space program (like TCPdump or IPTables) to attach a custom filter onto
		any socket. The filter code is sent to the kernel via SO_ATTACH_FILTER option
	-LibPcap is how this happens using TCPdump for example
**Learn Masking
	-Unskilled Attackers Pester Real Security Folk (urg, ack, psh, rst, syn, fin)

FLOW ANALYSIS
	-netflow (Cisco) aggregates IP flows & sends to collection pt for analysis
	-sflow (industry standard) isn't restricted to IP; built into ASIC

SERVER ID
	-OS detection
	-Helps determine need for custom exploits
	-Backporting (applying fix/patch to older software versions)

SIGNATURES
	1. TTL
	2. TCP Options - allow for byte code analysis/injection
	3. Selective Acknowledgement

FRAGMENTED PKT
	-reasons for
	-check ID number
	-sequence number and byte offest (start at 0 for counting offset)
		ether[12:2] (start at byte 12 and read 2 bytes; byte 12 looks like byte 13)
		tcp[13] = 0x12 (looking at SYN/ACK)
		tcp[2:2] = 0x0050 (looking at port 80)

hex nibble = 4096 | 256 | 16 | 1

**what parts of packet headers are part of each layer??? (ex: ICMP is L3 only)

PACKET INJECTION
	-covert payload transport
	-Censorship, ads, malware, notifications
	-performed by Edge & Core ISPs too
