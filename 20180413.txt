NETWORK EXPLOITATION

Hacker Methodology
	1. Recon (Footprint, scans, enumeration, net map)
	2. Gain Access
	3. Priv Escalation
	4. Post-exploitation
	5. Target Survey & Remote Forensic Analysis
	6. Cover Tracks (upon arrival & during departure)
	7. Collect Data (if any)
	8. Establish Persistence (rootkit+backdoor+RAT)

Cyber Threat Actors
	-Cyber criminals (Fancy Bear)
	-State-sponsored (CPT 174, TAO)
	-Hacktivists (Anonymous)
	-Insider threats (Bradley/Chelsea Manning)
	-Transnational actors (ISIS)
	-Individual actors or small groups (mom's basement)

Threat Actions
	-Malware
	-Hacking
	-Social Tactics
	-Misuse
	-Physical
	-Error
	-Environmental

Exploitation Methodologies
	-Internal vs External (Internal = easier)
	-Commonly Compromised Assets (domain controller, web server, email, phones)
	-Importance of Testing Tools (proofing exploits, only effective for software though)

Exfiltration done via outbound connections are very common, and hard to counter at the perimeter since this is an area that has been created to focus on incoming threats

Common protocols are used to mask data exfiltration: HTTP/HTTPS, FTP and DNS for example easily blend into normal outbound network traffic, thus obfuscating the attacker's actions
	-In-band vs Out-of-band (overt/covert)
	-Access (ex: keylogger on a timer)
	-Persistence
	-Means
	-Custom exfil tool vs Native utilities

Critical Systems
	- Assess Operational Architecture
	- What types of functions are controlled by systems?
	- How are dependencies represented among systems?
	- Geopgraphic (i.e. Control over infrastructure or area)
	- Physical (i.e. Router/hardware)
	- Logical (i.e. DNS/software, psexec[smb], RDP)
	- Cyber Persona (i.e. accounts/credentials/access to information)

Credentials

Admin/Domain Admin Credentials
	- Need to be audited
	- Should not have the ability to alter audit files
	- Require secondary approval

Access Controls
	- Behavioral analysis
	- Context Awareness
	- Multi-factor authentication

Gaining Access
	-SQL Injection is a code injection technique that could destroy or compromise the 				integrity of a database
	-SQL Injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques
	-SQL Injection involved placing of malicious code within SQL statements, via a web page's 			unvalidated user input

Exploit (access) vs Payload (shell code that takes advantage of the tgt)

Bind Shell vs Reverse Shell

Man in the Middle
	-Placing yourself in the middle of coms
	-Layer 2 (arp poison), Layer 3 (DNS poison, IP Spoof), and more

DoS (one on one atk) vs DDoS (gang bang)


Ashley Madison:
	- Responsibility claimed by the "Impact Team"
	- Approx. 9.7 Gb posted on Tor
	- Site source code posted MANY git repos
	- Little hard evidence released; not clear whether this was an insider or external hacking
Collateral Effects: divorce, suicide, clearance revocation

Yahoo Hacking:
	- Yahoo's hacking has been measured as the largest data breach in history
	- 2014 hack: 500 million accounts, 2014 hack: up to 1 billion accounts
	- Not disclosed until 2016
	- Two Russian FSB officials indicted
	- US has no extradition treaty with Russia
Collateral Effects: U.S. learned we aren't gangster, Verizon-Yahoo deal compromised

OPM Hack:
	- Breached December 2014
	- 21 Million current/former Fed. Employees' PII leaked
	- China is suspected of the breach
	- SF-86's...foreign contacts?
Collateral Effects: My IDcare subscriptions (they got hacked too)
