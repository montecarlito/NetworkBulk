Industroyer/Crash Override (wormable RAT)
	-delivered via phishing email
	-caused blackout in Ukranian power grid

Operational Tech vs Informational Tech
	-OT has real-time impact (critical infrastructure) and a 20+ year life cycle
	-IT isn't real-time and has 3-5 yr life cycles

Stuxnet took advantage of many zero day flaws in concert
	-destroyed centrifuges and blocked error codes = surprise

Industrial Control Systems are a popular target for their impact level.
	1. Human Machine Interfaces
	2. Analog Relays are the fundamental controllers and straighforward weaknesses
	3. Programmable Logic Controllers replaced them AR's
	4. Microcontrollers (Arduino)
	5. Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) for portable WAN connectivity
	6. Intelligent Electronic Devices combine RTU+PLC+maybeHMI's too

Controlled Process 
	-automation

Sensors
	-error & progress reporting
	-measurements
	-controlled changes
	-measured vs desired effects

Engineering Workstations
	-work with ICS's

Supervisory Workstations

Control System Operation (Control Theory)
	-Open Loop Control (HMI does the job but there's no sensors/feedback =cheap)
	-Closed Loop Control (sensors like PID give controller input for process mgmt)
	  (PID has proportional component [current value], Integral component [avg of past
	   values], and differential component [change])
	-most controllers don't even have an OS; many microcontrollers just use C 	  	  programming to run a terminal "while" loop.
	-data historians for AARs

DCS implements multilevel control across a LAN
SCADA ICS operates across a WAN
Process Control Systems are a subset of DCS

Energy Mgmt Systems
Industrial IoT (often wireless mesh and vulnerable)

MODBUS over TCP (default port 502)
OPC for sharing
DNP3 for electrical grids (clear text) 
Ethernet IP (Industrial Protocol) uses UDP for time-critical msg, TCP for non...
Profibus vs Pofinet

ICS Engineering Design Priorities:

    Functionality
    Profit
    Legal Compliance
    Personnel Safety
    Environmental Impact
    Security

ICS/IT Security Priorities: CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
OT Security Priorities: SAIC (safety, availability, integrity, confidentiality)

ICS Functional Zones (Purdue model)
	-Enterprise Zone
	-DMZ
	-Manufacturing Zone
	-Cell/Area Zone (Process, Basic Control, Area Supervisory, Manuf Ops & Control,
		Firewall)
